# Decks Template ([Demo](borisschapira.github.io/decks-template/))

Decks Template is an example of how you can use Jekyll to manage different training programs, each of them composer of several decks of slides, organized by chapters.

It makes a heavy use of Jekyll's collections:

- training programs, or as I call them "cursus", are a collection
- decks inside of each programs, are also a collection
- slides inside the decks are also a collection

In order to know which slide goes in which deck goes in which cursus, you will need to always name them the same way. That's all. _Convention over configuration_.

# Prerequisites

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

# Installation

```bash
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

# Usage

## Preparation

- Use the `_cursus` folder to manage your training programs
- Use the `_decks` folder to manage your decks
- Use the `_slides` folder to manage your slides

Training programs, decks and slides are ordered by the name of the file that represent them.

## Vizualize

The command

```
