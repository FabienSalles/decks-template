## Assembling using JSON

* You'll find `list.json` files:
 * at the root of the __slides_ folder: they allow the template to construct a deck index
 * optionaly, in each deck folder, to organize slide (if there is no file, alpha order is used)

* `list.json` may reference a subset of slides if you need it to (handy for only picking what's interesting for your need).
